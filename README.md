### 100 days of code - Log

**Day 1: 7th October 2022**
Today's Progress: After a lengthy time away from coding due to family reasons and then needing to build the confidence to learn what I have forgotten, I have finally started 100 days challenge. So I have started creating a project for a music library to store music with artist and albums.
New update for Ubuntu meant I had to wait some time before I could start, which also meant I had to re-install MySQL Workbench.
Had issues connecting Docker container to MySQL and after searching Google found that I didn't have the right access. A quick google walk through and issue resolved. Hopefully all ready to start diving deeper for Day 2.

**Thoughts:** Felt worried about making a start on what I could do after taking some time off. But thankfully Google and some notes I had helped me through. Some teething issues that I didn't forsee but not too much of an issue. Just got to remember it's not a sprint but a marathon.
