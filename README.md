## Wxmnath #100DaysOfCode Challenge

### Purpose of my challenge:

- Build a habit of coding atleast 1 hour a day
- Focusing on backend coding, using My SQL, Docker & Express.js
- Build a minimum of 2 projects, with the 1st project with the help of Manchester Bootcamp course.

### Tips to help me

- Update daily progress through Github & Twitter
- Start slowly and spend time asking questions of what I am doing and spend time researching.
- Aim to encourage 2 other people a day who are also doing the challenge.
- Accept failures and reach out when unsure - Any help is appreciated! :)

### 100 days of code - Log

**Day 1: 7th October 2022**
Today's Progress: After a lengthy time away from coding due to family reasons and then needing to build the confidence to learn what I have forgotten, I have finally started 100 days challenge. So I have started creating a project for a music library to store music with artist and albums.
New update for Ubuntu meant I had to wait some time before I could start, which also meant I had to re-install MySQL Workbench.
Had issues connecting Docker container to MySQL and after searching Google found that I didn't have the right access. A quick google walk through and issue resolved. Hopefully all ready to start diving deeper for Day 2.

**Thoughts:** Felt worried about making a start on what I could do after taking some time off. But thankfully Google and some notes I had helped me through. Some teething issues that I didn't forsee but not too much of an issue. Just got to remember it's not a sprint but a marathon.

**Day 2: 8th October 2022**
Installed express framework as a dependency. Express is a web application framework that provides broad features for building web & mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage and a hybrid application.
It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.
Express creates API's and web application with ease,
It saves a lot of coding.
Started the day installing **Express.js** as a dependency.

Express is a framework that helps manage servers and routes by creating API's. It saves alot of coding being written out, which is great news for me :)

Then created app.js file where I call express at the top of the page.

Also created index file calling in my app.js file at the top.

Installed Nodemon as a dev dependency.
Nodemon watches the project files and automatically updates the local host meaning I don't have to stop and start the local host each time.

**Thoughts:** More confidence going in to it today. Spent time updating the project following the instructions set out and time understanding why we use express. Overall good start, but this I feel is the easy part :)

**Day 3 & 4: 9th & 10th October 2022**
Wasn't able to do much yesterday, so combining two reports in one.
Started installing dotenv dependency - A tool that allows for local environment variables that are sensitive information from being accessed from the front end/browser.
This type of information could be API keys, the host, ports or the database information.
My sensitive information for this project is stored in .env file which will be kept in my .gitignore file.

Then from installing mysql2 I created both create-database script and a drop-database using the require('dotenv').config to access my sensitive information such as passwords and hosts etc.

**Thoughts:**
Took me some time to understand how all this pieced together, but think I got the gist of things in the end. Some more practice on this is needed at some point, but wary that I don't hang about too long at this stage as I can always refresh on this again.
